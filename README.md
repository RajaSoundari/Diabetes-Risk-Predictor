# Diabetes-Risk-Predictor
This data science-powered webpage harnesses the capabilities of Python's data science stack, including scikit-learn, pandas to build predictive models that assess your diabetes risk based on an array of health-related features.

## ABOUT:
The Diabetes Risk Predictor is a web application built using Streamlit and machine learning that helps users assess their risk of developing diabetes based on personal health information.
It provides valuable insights to encourage users to make informed lifestyle choices for better health.

## Libraries Used:
### 1. Streamlit:
        Streamlit is the main library used to create the web application user interface and define the application's behavior.
### 2. Pandas:
        Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It is used it to read and manipulate the dataset containing health-related information.
### 3. os:
        The os library is used for operating system-related functions, such as working with file paths. It you used it to specify the path to the dataset.
### 4. OrdinalEncoder:
        This is a part of Scikit-Learn (sklearn) library.The OrdinalEncoder is used to encode categorical variables with ordinal relationships, like "smoking_history" and "gender," into numerical values that can be used by the machine learning model.
### 5. DecisionTreeClassifier:
        To build a machine learning model for diabetes risk prediction.

## Disclaimer:
    The Diabetes Risk Predictor is for informational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice. Users are encouraged to consult healthcare professionals for accurate assessments and guidance regarding their health.
